 :point_right: Cyclic sort is a sorting algorithm which is widely used in programming.
 
 :point_right: It is based on the fact that the list or an array has numbers in the range from 1 to n i.e [1,n] where n is the size of the array/list.
 
 
 ##  ➡️ When to apply Cyclic Sort
 
 :point_right: We shall apply cyclic sort when we are given numbers in a range from [1,n].
